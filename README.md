- **Headless architecture** - Logic separated from presentation for ultimate styling freedom

- **Accessibility built-in** - ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation included
- **TypeScript-first** - Complete type definitions for excellent developer experience
- **Lightweight & tree-shakeable** - Import only what you need

## Component Architecture

Strive UI implements three powerful component patterns:

1. **Headless Components** - Logic and behavior without styling constraints
2. **Compound Components** - Flexible composition with context-based state sharing
3. **Polymorphic Components** - Render as any HTML element while maintaining functionality
