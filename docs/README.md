## Key Documentation Sections

### Getting Started

Start here if you're new to Strive UI. These guides will help you install the library, understand its architecture, and implement your first components.

### Component Patterns

Strive UI implements three powerful component patterns:

1. **Headless Components** - Separate logic from presentation for complete styling freedom
2. **Compound Components** - Flexible composition with context-based state sharing
3. **Polymorphic Components** - Render as any HTML element while maintaining functionality

### Accessibility

All Strive UI components are built with accessibility in mind, following WCAG guidelines and WAI-ARIA patterns. The accessibility guide provides details on how we implement accessibility features and how you can maintain them in your implementations.

## Documentation Standards

Each component documentation includes:

- Clear, concise description
- Import examples
- Props API reference with types
- Usage examples with code snippets
- Accessibility considerations
- Performance optimization tips
