## Documentation Guidelines

When creating or updating component documentation, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Use the template**: Use the [component documentation template](./templates/component-doc-template.md) as a starting point.

2. **Be comprehensive**: Include all relevant information about the component, including props, variants, examples, and accessibility considerations.

3. **Include examples**: Provide clear, concise examples that demonstrate the component's usage.

4. **Document props**: Document all props, including their types, default values, and descriptions.

5. **Accessibility**: Always include information about accessibility features and considerations.

6. **Best practices**: Include guidelines and best practices for using the component.

7. **Keep it updated**: When the component changes, update the documentation accordingly.

Each component should have its own documentation file in its component directory. The documentation should follow the structure outlined in the template and include:

- Component description
- Import information
- Features list
- Usage examples
- Props documentation
- Variants, sizes, and states (if applicable)
- Accessibility information
